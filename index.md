1. Crack three eggs in a bowl.
 
 Now, you are going to want to crack the eggs to such a way that you dont make a mess.
  if you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into abowl.
  
  Basically **take** the same guidence as above: dont be messy, but it you are, clean it up!
